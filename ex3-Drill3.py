print "I'm making chocolate chip cookies. Here's the list of ingredients:"
print "3 / 4 cup granulated sugar"
print "3 / 4 cup firmly packed brown sugar"
print "1 cup butter, softened"
print "2 large eggs"
print "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
print "2 cups all-purpose flour"
print "1 tsp. baking soda"
print "1 / 2 tsp. salt"
print "2 cups chocolate chips"

print "(1) First, I combine butter, sugars, eggs, and vanilla."
print "I use my 3 / 4 cup measuring cup for the brown sugar. For the granulated sugar, I use my 1 / 2 cup measuring cup and my 1 / 4 cup measuring cup:"
print "Is it true that 1 / 2 cup + 1 / 4 cup = 3 / 4 cup?"
print 1 / 2 + 1 / 4 == 3 / 4
print "(2) Next, I add flour, baking soda, and salt."
print "Because my teaspoon has vanilla on it, I use my 1 / 2 teaspoon measure for the baking soda."
print "Is it true that 1 / 2 tsp. + 1 / 2 tsp. = 1 tsp.?"
print 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 == 1
print "Now I'll use the 1 / 4 teaspoon measure for the salt."
print "Is it true that 1 / 4 tsp * 2 = 1 / 2 tsp.?"
print 1 / 4 * 2 == 1 / 2
print "(3) Then I add the chocolate chips."
print "My 1 cup measuring cup still has flour on it, so I'll have to use my 1 / 3 cup measuring cup."
print "Is it true that 1 / 3 cup * 6 = 2 cups?"
print 1 / 3 * 6 == 2
print "(4) Now I roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the cookie sheets."
print "I only have 2 cookie sheets. Each one only fits about 8 cookies. How many cookies can I have on the trays at one time?"
print 8 * 2
print "(5) Time to bake them! I place the cookies in the oven for 9 minutes at 375 degrees."
print "The recipe says it makes 48 cookies. I can only put one cookie sheet at a time in the oven. How many times will I have to put a new batch in the oven?"
print 48 / 8
print "How many minutes will it take to bake all 48 cookies?"
print 48 / 8 * 9
print "Great! I'll learn some Python while I wait."
